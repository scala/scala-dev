# Scala 2.13.13

The Scala team at Lightbend is pleased to announce Scala 2.13.13.

The following changes are highlights of this release:

### Language

* Support binary integer literals using `0b`, as in Java ([#10656](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10656) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))

### Compatibility

* TASTy reader: support Scala 3.4 ([#10670](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10670) by [@bishabosha](https://github.com/bishabosha))
* Support certain Java libraries compiled on JDK 21 ([#10675](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10675) by [@SethTisue](https://github.com/SethTisue))
* For JDK 22 support, upgrade to ASM 9.6 ([#10576](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10576) by [@Philippus](https://github.com/Philippus))

### Align with Scala 3

* Allow either `-Xsource:3` (for preparing to switch to 3) or `-Xsource:3-cross` (for crossbuilding on 2 and 3); many existing users of `-Xsource:3` should switch to `-Xsource:3-cross` ([#10573](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10573) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* For migration to 3, accommodate case companion as function ([#10648](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10648) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* Scala 3 migration warning for implicits found in package prefix ([#10621](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10621) by [@lrytz](https://github.com/lrytz))

### Other improvements

* `-Yrelease` supplements `--release`, allows access to additional JVM packages ([#10543](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10543) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* Add `-Xlint:named-booleans` to lint unnamed boolean literal args [ci: last-only] ([#10612](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10612) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* Respect `java.lang.Deprecated` annotation even in Scala sources ([#10517](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10517) by [@kapunga](https://github.com/kapunga))
* Optimize tail recursion on effectively final methods even when `final` keyword is absent ([#10629](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10629) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* Add `-Xlint:pattern-shadow` to lint pattern varids which are backquotable ([#8806](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/8806) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* In mixed compilation, allow Java sources to reference `MODULE$` ([#10644](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10644) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* Scaladoc: re-align `-doc-source-url` behavior with 2.12 ([#10581](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10581) by [@lrytz](https://github.com/lrytz))

### Known issues

* Users of sbt must upgrade to sbt 1.9.9 to use the `console` task
  to access the 2.13.13 REPL ([sbt/sbt#7502](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/7502));
  error message is `NoSuchMethodError: org.jline.utils.AttributedString.fromAnsi`
* Regression: Scaladoc generation may fail if you are using the TASTy reader
  to access Scala 3 dependencies ([scala/bug#12955](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12955));
  error message is "Unsupported Scala 3 generic tuple type"; we'll fix it in 2.13.14
* Regression: on JDK 11 (but not 8 or 17 or 21), the REPL prints a
  harmless "illegal reflective access" warning at startup
  ([scala/bug#12957](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12957));
  we'll fix it in 2.13.14

## Compatibility

Upgrading from 2.12? Enable `-Xmigration` while upgrading to request migration advice from the compiler.
