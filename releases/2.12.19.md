* Support JDK 22 in optimizer (by upgrading to ASM 9.6) ([#10575](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10575) by [@Philippus](https://github.com/Philippus))
* New `-Yrelease` option supplements `--release`, allows access to additional JVM packages ([#10671](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10671) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* Update compiler's scala-xml dependency to 2.2.0 (was 2.1.0) ([#10459](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10459) by [@SethTisue](https://github.com/SethTisue))

And it has **bugfixes**:

* Fix rare `NullPointerException` in some tree-based collections ([#10640](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10640) by [@lrytz](https://github.com/lrytz))
* Improved `InterruptedException` handling for `Future`s ([#10379](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10379) by [@szeiger](https://github.com/szeiger))
