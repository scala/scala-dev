Scala 2.12.15:

 * Avoids `IllegalArgumentException` in JDK17+ for lambda deserialization ([#9676](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9676)
 * Upgrades to ASM 9.2, for JDK 18 support in optimizer ([#9701](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9701)

and facilitates cross-building with Scala 3 with:

 * Allow `case` in pattern bindings even without `-Xsource:3` ([#9740](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9740) by [@smarter](https://github.com/smarter))
 * Allow `import x.{*, given}` under `-Xsource:3` ([#9736](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9736) by [@smarter](https://github.com/smarter))
 * Handle star in import selector (under `-Xsource:3`) ([#9665](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9665) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
