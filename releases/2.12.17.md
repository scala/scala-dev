# Scala 2.12.17 (DRAFT)

The Scala team at Lightbend is pleased to announce the availability of Scala 2.12.17.

This release has the following notable changes affecting compatibility:

* Always emit Java 8 bytecode on 2.12, regardless of `-release`; deprecate `-target` ([#10109](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10109))
* Upgrade the 2.12 scala-compiler's dependency on scala-xml to 2.1.0 (was 1.0.6) ([#10108](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10108))

It also fixes this regression in Scala 2.12.16:

* Correctly handle overloads in mixed compilation with Java inner classes (fixing 2.12.16 regression) ([#10045](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10045))

and aids migration to Scala 2.13:

* Under `-Xsource:2.13`, warn about changed precedence in imports ([#10095](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10095))

and eases cross-compilation with Scala 3:

* Accept and ignore `using` in method signature (to aid cross-building with Scala 3) ([#10075](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10075))

and enables improved tooling:

* Tooling support: Add a tree attachment to mark auto-applications ([#10063](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10063))
* Tooling support: Attachments for infix Apply and postfix Select ([#10042](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10042))
* Tooling support: Fix AST positions for XML literals, selections from blocks ([#10040](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10040))
