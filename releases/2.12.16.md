# Scala 2.12.16

This release improves compatibility with recent JDKs:

* For JDK 19 support, use ASM 9.3 ([#10000](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10000))
* Make `-target` support JDK 8 through 19 (and deprecate 5 through 7) ([#9916](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9916))
* Fix codegen for `MethodHandle.invoke` (et al) under JDK 17 `-release` ([#9930](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9930))
* Deprecate `AnyVal#formatted(formatString)`, to avoid conflict with JDK 15+ method ([#9783](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9783))

and aids cross-compiling with Scala 3:

* Allow `?` as a wildcard even without `-Xsource:3` ([#10005](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10005))

and improves security and error reporting:

* Error on source files with Unicode directional formatting characters ([#10023](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10023), [#10030](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10030))
* Fix range position end for infix calls ([#9761](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9761))
