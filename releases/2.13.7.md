The Scala team at Lightbend is pleased to announce the availability of Scala 2.13.7.

### Align with Scala 3

* Update TASTy reader to support Scala 3.1 ([#9791](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9791) by [@bishabosha](https://github.com/bishabosha))
* Allow `import x.{*, given}` under `-Xsource:3` ([#9724](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9724) by [@smarter](https://github.com/smarter))
* Allow `case` in pattern bindings even without `-Xsource:3` ([#9721](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9721) by [@smarter](https://github.com/smarter))
* Deprecate top-level wildcard type parameters ([#9712](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9712) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))

### JDK and Java compatibility

* Support JDK 18 ([#9702](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9702) by [@SethTisue](https://github.com/SethTisue))
* Support JDK 16 records in Java sources ([#9551](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9551) by [@harpocrates](https://github.com/harpocrates))
* Allow concrete private interface methods in Java sources ([#9748](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9748) by [@dengziming](https://github.com/dengziming))
* Use `StringConcatFactory` for string concatenation on JDK 9+ ([#9556](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9556) by [@harpocrates](https://github.com/harpocrates))

### Android compatibility

* Add `ClassValueCompat` to support systems without `java.lang.ClassValue` (such as Android) ([#9752](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9752) by [@nwk37011](https://github.com/nwk37011))
 * For Android compatibility, make `Statics.releaseFence()` also catch `NoSuchMethodException` for `java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.releaseFence()` call ([#9739](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9739) by [@nwk37011](https://github.com/nwk37011))

### Concurrency

* Fix asymmetric failure behavior of `Future#{zip,zipWith,traverse,sequence}` by making them fail fast regardless of ordering ([#9655](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9655) by [@lihaoyi](https://github.com/lihaoyi))
