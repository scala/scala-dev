# Scala 2.12.18

This release improves **compatibility**:

* Support JDK 20 with ASM 9.5 upgrade, by @Philippus ([#10185](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10185), [#10362](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10362))

It also aids **migration** to Scala 2.13 and Scala 3:

* Under `-Xsource:2.13`, warn when inherited takes precedence over outer definitions ([#10297](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10297), [#10321](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10321))
* Under `-Xsource:2.13`, flag eta-expanding methods without parameter lists ([#10283](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10283))
* Under `-Xsource:2.13`, don't GLB binders of type patterns, use the type directly ([#10298](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10298))

and improves **linting**:

* Lint for integral divisions that are widened to a float ([#10313](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10313))

and enables improved **tooling**:

* Preserve tree attachment in the typer's `Block`/`Apply` inversion transform ([#10176](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10176))
