# Scala 2.13.12 (DRAFT)

The Scala team at Lightbend is pleased to announce Scala 2.13.12.

The following changes are highlights of this release:

### Feature: Quickfixes

For some errors and warnings, the compiler now suggests an edit that could fix the issue. Tooling such as IDEs can then offer the edits, or the compiler itself will make the change if run again with `-quickfix`.

* Implement quickfixes, aka actionable diagnostics (via `CodeAction`) ([#10406](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10406) by [@eed3si9n](https://github.com/eed3si9n))
* Add `-quickfix` compiler option to apply quickfixes to source files ([#10482](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10482) by [@lrytz](https://github.com/lrytz))
* Add quickfixes to some warnings and errors ([#10484](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10484) by [@lrytz](https://github.com/lrytz))

### Align with Scala 3

* Emit migration warnings under `-Xsource:3` as fatal warnings, not errors; `-Xmigration` disables fatality ([#10439](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10439) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* Warn about `@elidable` under `-Xsource:3` ([#10377](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10377) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))

### Collections

* `IndexedSeq#head` now throws `NoSuchElementException` (not `IndexOutOfBoundsException`) ([#10392](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10392) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))

### Regression fixes

* Deduplicate `JavaDeprecatedAttr` in `ClassfileParser` ([#10422](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10422) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* Avoid brittle flags encoding for Java enums ([#10424](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10424) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))

### Tooling

The following change is mainly of concern to tooling maintainers.

* In-source sbt compiler bridge ([#10472](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10472) by [@lrytz](https://github.com/lrytz))

## Compatibility

As usual for our minor releases, Scala 2.13.12 is [binary-compatible](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/binary-compatibility-of-scala-releases.html) with the whole Scala 2.13 series.

Upgrading from 2.12? Enable `-Xmigration` while upgrading to request migration advice from the compiler.
