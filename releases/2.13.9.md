 * Accept and ignore `using` in method calls (to aid cross-building with Scala 3) ([#10064](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10064) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
 * Fix handling of nulls in Java `ConcurrentMap` wrapper ([#10027](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10027) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))

 * Support JDK 19 ([#10001](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10001) by [@Philippus](https://github.com/Philippus))
 * To aid cross building, allow `?` as a wildcard even without `-Xsource:3` ([#9990](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9990) by [@smarter](https://github.com/smarter))
 * Fix null-pointer regression in `Vector#prependedAll` and `Vector#appendedAll` ([#9983](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9983) by [@retronym](https://github.com/retronym))

 * For troubleshooting compiler, add `-Vdebug-type-error` (and remove `-Yissue-debug`) ([#9824](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9824) by [@tribbloid](https://github.com/tribbloid))
 * Use subcolon args to simplify optimizer options ([#9810](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9810) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
