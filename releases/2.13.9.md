# Scala 2.13.9 (DRAFT)

The Scala team at Lightbend is pleased to announce the availability of Scala 2.13.9.

The following changes are highlights of this release:

### Compatibility with Scala 3

* Tasty Reader: Add support for Scala 3.2 ([#10068](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10068))
* Tasty Reader: Restrict access to experimental definitions ([#10020](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10020))
* To aid cross-building, accept and ignore `using` in method calls ([#10064](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10064) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* To aid cross-building, allow `?` as a wildcard even without `-Xsource:3` ([#9990](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9990))
* Make Scala-3-style implicit resolution explicitly opt-in rather than bundled in `-Xsource:3` ([#10012](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10012) by [@povder](https://github.com/povder))
* Prefer type of overridden member when inferring (under `-Xsource:3`) ([#9891](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9891) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))

### JDK version support

* Make `-release` more useful, deprecate `-target`, align with Scala 3 ([#9982](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9982) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* Support JDK 19 ([#10001](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10001) by [@Philippus](https://github.com/Philippus))

### Warnings and lints

* Add `-Wnonunit-statement` to warn about discarded values in statement position ([#9893](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9893) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* Make unused-import warnings easier to silence (support filtering by `origin=`) ([#9939](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9939) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* Add `-Wperformance` lints for `*Ref` boxing and nonlocal `return` ([#9889](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9889) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))

### Language improvements

* Improve support for Unicode supplementary characters in identifiers and string interpolation ([#9805](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9805) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))

### Compiler options

* Use subcolon args to simplify optimizer options ([#9810](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9810) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* For troubleshooting compiler, add `-Vdebug-type-error` (and remove `-Yissue-debug`) ([#9824](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9824) by [@tribbloid](https://github.com/tribbloid))

### Security

* Error on source files with Unicode directional formatting characters ([#10017](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10017))
* Prevent `Function0` execution during `LazyList` deserialization ([#10118](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10118))

### Bugfixes

* Emit all bridge methods non-final (perhaps affecting serialization compat) ([#9976](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9976))
* Fix null-pointer regression in `Vector#prependedAll` and `Vector#appendedAll` ([#9983](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9983))
* Improve concurrent behavior of Java `ConcurrentMap` wrapper
 ([#10027](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10027) by [@igabaydulin](https://github.com/igabaydulin))
* Preserve null policy in wrapped Java `Map`s ([#10129](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10129) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))

Changes that shipped in Scala 2.12.16 and 2.12.17 are also included in this release.
