name: General issue
about: An empty template for general issues
---
Mostly for internal planning of Scala development, also for tracking less concrete ideas for improvements, long running tasks, 
maintenance of the code base.

NOTE: this tracker is *not* intended for user-facing bug reports, anything that would block a release, 
or concrete, directly actionable, user-facing feature requests -- use https://github.com/scala/bug/issues for those.

If unsure, please ask on https://contributors.scala-lang.org
