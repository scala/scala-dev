# Scala 2.13.10 (DRAFT)

The Scala team at Lightbend is pleased to announce the availability of Scala 2.13.10.

The following changes are highlights of this release:

### Regressions fixed

* Fix 2.13.9 regression which broke binary compatibility of case classes which are also value classes ([#10155](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10155))
* Fix 2.13.9 regression in linting, causing spurious "variable x is never used" warnings ([#10154](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10154))

### Other notable changes

* `-Xsource:3` now respects refinements by whitebox macro overrides ([#10160](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10160) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* Scaladoc tool: fix parsing bug which could cause very slow performance or incorrect output ([#10175](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10175) by [@liang3zy22](https://github.com/liang3zy22))
* Restore `-Vprint-args`, for echoing arguments provided to compiler ([#10164](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10164) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))

## Compatibility

As usual for our minor releases, Scala 2.13.10 is [binary-compatible](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/binary-compatibility-of-scala-releases.html) with the whole Scala 2.13 series.

Upgrading from 2.12? Enable `-Xmigration` while upgrading to request migration advice from the compiler.
