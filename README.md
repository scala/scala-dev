## Tracker for core Scala development

Please use our [official issue tracker](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues) to report bugs.

The issue tracker in this repository is used to coordinate
and plan the ongoing work on the Scala 2.x major releases.

The canonical repository for the Scala distribution itself
is [scala/scala](https://github.com/scala/scala).

The list of [planned milestones](https://github.com/scala/scala/milestones)
in `scala/scala` and the [release theme issues](https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/324) in this tracker
show how we are progressing towards the plans in our [Roadmap](https://scala-lang.org/news/roadmap-2.13.html).
